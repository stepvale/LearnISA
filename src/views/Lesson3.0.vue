    <h1>Are ISAs Legitimate?</h1>
    <div class ="textbody">
      ISAs are an "equity funding" alternative to "debt funding." It's an interesting idea that's been around since at least the 1950s, when Milton Friedman, the famous Economist, proposed the idea.

However, they've had a rocky history since then. Yale offered ISAs to students in the 1970s, but a lot of people had to pay back more than they expected, so they eventually shut down the program.

In the early 2000s, a few private companies started offering ISAs, but most of them didn't make enough money for the investors and had to close down.
