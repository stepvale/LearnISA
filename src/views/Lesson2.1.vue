    <h1>2.1 How is This Different from a Loan?</h1>
    <div class ="textbody">
      <p>The traditional way to get money for college is through student loans. Loans are a type of debt.</p>
      <p>So are ISAs a type of debt too?</p>
      <p>Nope, there's a critical difference!</p>
      <p>If you have debt, you typically have to pay them back no matter how much you earn. With an ISA, you only pay back a percentage of what you earn. So if you earn a little, you pay back a little and if you earn a lot you pay back a lot.</p>
